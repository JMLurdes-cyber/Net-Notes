This is the layer responsible for **routing** connections, or with another words, finding the correct/optimal "path" from a network to another and keeping/correcting said connections.

They use the [[Internet Protocol (IP)]] to send said information in **[[frames]]**, fragments of data made to be optimally sent through networks, through the use of the [[Layer 4- Transport|transport protocols]].


Any issue related to the routes of the information comes from this layer.
