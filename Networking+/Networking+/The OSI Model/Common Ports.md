### INSIGHTS
Something that i noticed is the follow-up to the devices, being that several of the ports are made for automation of services. Syslog, MSQL, SNMP traps and DHCP all are made to automatically unite their roles into an easier system, be it making a single log, making a single database, making automatic alarms or automatically assigning IPs to devices.

It also seems to be tying with another resources, since Databases and Logs will require a lot of space, which is not easy to come across, unless you use some external Device. And those devices also automatically fulfill another role. Routers tend to come with DHCP integrated and Windows comes with MSQL, CISF and RDP usually. And the others? Information gathering or connections, be it for file transferal like FTP and FTPS, desktop like RDP, terminal like SSH or telnet, or server web connection, like HTTP/HTTPS.

All in all, they seem to be summarized in: *Automation based or Connection based protocols*.

#### Questions
- What is the difference between SSH and Telnet?
- What does it mean for a protocol to be "Secure"?
- Cite all the automation based protocols
