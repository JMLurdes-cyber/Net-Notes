### KEY TAKEAWAYS
They can operate in different [[The OSI Model|layers]]:

| Device                         | Layer(s)  | Uses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Realistic Use case                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Router                         | 2-3       | Commonly used to connect two networks together. Can be used as a switch on layer 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Connection home to the Internet/ the office/ etc                                |
| Firewall                       | 3-4-7     | Commonly used to filter ports and protocols for extra safety. Next Generation Firewalls *(NGFW)* can be used to filter smartly based on context or given information. Can also work as a lower grade router or even as a VPN, even if they would lack the QoS that makes them be more effective, ultimately. Usually found at the innermost part or the outermost part of a net          | Protecting a network from undesired ports used by malicious actors              |
| Switch                         | 2 - 3     | They are use to forward packets to the right host, but will vary in how they do so depending on the layer. 2nd layer switches will only find the MAC address, so in VLANs and such they will not be able to find the correct address without using a router. 3rd layer ones can perform routing and IP scanning, so they could find the same IP in the same scenario without the router. | Used in an office to send information to the device that requested it           |
| IDS                            | 3-4-5-6-7 | Commonly used to detect attacks (or possible attempts) through the net. Doesn't protect against them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | In a big enterprise, to check the incoming data                                 |
| IPS                            | 3-4-5-6-7 | Commonly used to protect against attacks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | An antivirus would fall in this category?                                       |
| Load Balancer                  |           | Commonly used to manage the load of a network to be able to avoid things such as crashes. It has a long variety of functions, such as real-time answers and caching                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | An MMO having a lot of servers sending you to another once the server gets full |
| Proxy                          |           | Commonly used as a "middle man", standing between the servers and the net to catch, test or check incoming communications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                 |
| NAS - Network Attached Storage |           | File-level communication, you can access files within a system, but cannot/need not maintain things like the OS, file type, or in general, the folder system. You access files. That's it.                                                                                                                                                                                               | Like finding a book in a library                                                |
| SAN - Storage Area Network     |           | Storage-level communication used to get/manage files. Gives a full block, similar to how a mounted memory would look in a computer, giving full control, but needs to be maintained, organized and set up (file types, for example) by the user.                                                                                                                                         | Like finding a shelf in a library                                               |
| Access Point                   |           | Connected to a central management station, they ensure that wireless connection reaches the whole area without downtimes nor offline areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | My own workplace                                                                |
