The ****Open Systems Interconnections*** Reference Model is a scheme/guide that describes how data and information is relayed from our screens/inputs all the way to the computer, and how it takes in said information.  
  
By understanding this model we can speak and communicate using a standard about the network, in a way that everyone understands. It also helps in isolating errors, helping during troubleshooting since we'll be able to know where is the issue/how does it affect/why it may pop up.  

There are 7 layers in total:
- **[[Layer 7 - Application]]** 
>		 User interaction
- **[[Layer 6 - Presentation|Layer 6: Presentation]]**  
>		Application encryption (SSL/Tls)
- **[[Layer 5 - Session]]**  
>		Control protocols, tunneling protocols, links presentation with transport
- **[[Layer 4- Transport|Layer 4: Transport]]**  
>		TCP segment, UDP datagram
- **[[Layer 3 - Network|Layer 3 : Network]]**
>		IP Addresses, Routers, Packets
- **[[Layer 2- Data Link|Layer 2: Data Link]]**
>		Frames, MAC address, Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-48)
-  **[[Layer 1 - Physical|Layer 1: Physical]]**  
> 		Cables, Fiber, Signal
