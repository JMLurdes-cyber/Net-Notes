### CONCEPT 
Understanding the 3 main models of cloud computing and how they balance control, responsibility and convenience

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

There are **THREE MODELS** that we speak of when we talk about cloud computing:

| Models                             | Function                                                                                                                                                                        | Example                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| SaaS - Software as a Service       | Used when the only thing to be used is the application, without needing to set up anything nor do back end work. You just use it, and it works                                  | Gmail, Office, Arknights           |
| PaaS - Platform as a Service       | The medium point between client and platform, it is used when somebody wants to use the cloud wile things such as the maintenance or infrastructure are handled by the provider | Several websites                   |
| IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service | You are responsible for the management, security and data, alongside the setups and everything else. The highest level of control                                               | Google App Engine, Heroku, Netlify |

### INSIGHTS
During this, and calling back to the [[Networking Devices|NAS and SAN]], i've noticed that a lot of structures, systems and devices are made as an attempt to balance comfort and control. Comfortable options are easier to set up at the cost of all agency over the data, whilst controlled environments are much harder to set up and manage but give you full agency over everything.
