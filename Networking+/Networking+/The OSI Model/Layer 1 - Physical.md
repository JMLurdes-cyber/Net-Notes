This is the layer that takes care of the physical connections of the network. There are basically no protocols in this layer, all of the problems to be troubleshoot are physical. 

The way this layer sends information is through the use of **bits**, electrical signals that cause slight changes in electricity, frequency or cause sounds to send information to the other parts of the hardware. 

If there is an issue in this layer, it is absolutely **HARDWARE BASED**.
