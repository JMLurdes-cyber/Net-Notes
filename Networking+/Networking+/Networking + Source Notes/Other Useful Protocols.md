| ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol | Communication | Information about networking current status and error alerting                                                     | Ping is a function based on ICMP                        |
| GRE - Generic Routing Encapsulation      | Communication | Direct route encapsulation of packets. It doesn't provide encryption, it just tells the package which route to go. | One of the many protocols of VPNs. It creates a tunnel. |

[[Networking functions|VPNs]] are incredibly useful devices that are used for communication, but to truly understand all of their functions, we need to study the way that the connections are made

VPNS usually connect via Software or through the use of **Concentrators**, be it stand-alone devices or built-in in firewalls that manages the encryption, decryption and tunneling of inputted information.
