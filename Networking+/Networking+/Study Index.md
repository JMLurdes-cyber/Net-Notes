***REMEMBER***
Use the ***SOAR*** Method:
- **SELECT** the most important pieces of information
- **ORGANIZE** the information into your own thoughts, WITH YOUR OWN WORDS, NOT LOOK
- **ASSOCIATE** the information with something familiar with you (metaphors, analogies, etc)
- **REGULATE** the information learnt (check how much did you remember)

Use the ***ZETTELKASTEN*** method:
- Transform your notes into atomic versions of themselves.
- Do not explain what it is, explain why it is, how it is or what it means
- Give a personal interpretation or insight
- It has to be able to be linked to another note
